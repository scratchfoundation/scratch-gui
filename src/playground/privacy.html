            <p>We may record anonymous aggregated access logs when you interact with the site.

            <p>When using projects that contain "cloud variables", your username (randomly generated or set by user), project ID, and some technical details may be logged. This information is deleted within 14 days. The data stored in cloud variables is purged within 24 hours of no users being connected to a given project. You can opt out of this data collection by disabling cloud variables.</p>

            <p>By default, your username (randomly generated or set by user) is persisted between visits in your browser's "localStorage". To mitigate the possibility of uniquely identifying users with this feature, all randomly generated usernames are anonymized. However, usernames explicitly set by a user may be logged verbatim.</p>
