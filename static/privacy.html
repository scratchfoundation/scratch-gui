            <h2>Data collection</h2>

            <p>We may record aggregated statistics when you interact with the site. These logs may include the number of requests, type of requests, errors, referrers, browser information, system information, your country, and other information. These logs do not contain IP addresses or persistent identifiers.</p>

            <p>When interacting with cloud variables, the project ID and your username may be additionally logged. This information is deleted within 14 days.</p>

            <p>Your randomly generated or chosen username is stored in your browser's local storage. To mitigate the potential to track users with this feature, all randomly generated usernames are anonymized in server-side logs. However, usernames explicitly set by a user may be logged.</p>

            <h2>Data use</h2>

            <p>The data we collect is used to monitor use, prevent abuse, and improve the site. Collected data is not used to track users or show advertisements.</p>

            <p>Any personal information that we collect is never shared or sold to any third party, unless necessary to provide the service or to comply with the laws of the United States. Anonymous aggregated information may be shared.</p>
